    <p><a href="https://www.giants.com/">The New York Giants</a> were founded in 1925 by Tim Mara.  They play in the NFC East division along with the Dallas Cowboys, Philadelphia Eagles and Washington Reskins.
    In the NFL era the Giants have won the Super Bowl four times, most recently in 2011 against the New England Patriots.  Since their last Super Bowl victory, the Giants have struggled
    to make an impact resulting in coaching changes and player trades.  Their current coach, Pat Shurmur, is entering his second year with his sites set on bringing glory back to Big Blue.
    Along with his positive attitude and the plethora of players he has to choose from, there's reason to be optimistic.</p>
