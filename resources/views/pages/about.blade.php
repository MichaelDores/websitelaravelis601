            Eli Manning NYG Bio
        </h2>
        <br>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Manning">Eli Manning</a> entered the league in 2004.  He was drafted by the Sand Diego Charges but was immediately
    traded to the New York Giants.  Within the first few years of his career he had already reached the pinnacle after winning
    his first Super Bowl.  A few years later he won his second championship and cemented his legacy in NFL history.  In both Super Bowl
    victories he was named the game's most valuable player.  Although Eli is approaching the end of his playing career,
    he is still able to make an impact on the field and is greatly appreciated by the fans for what he's accomplished.</p>
